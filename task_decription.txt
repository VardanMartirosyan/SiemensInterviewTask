Please create a program which will track and report memory and runtime statistics of given processes over hosts.

Program should work on Linux, should be executed from bash command line

Usage:

dumpProcStat <process_name> <period> <hostfile>

                process name – Required argument. Type: string. Program should track the processes which names contain this string.

                hostfile – Optional argument. Type: string name of a file which contains list of hostnames line-by-line The program should continuously look for processes and report statistics on all these hosts sequentially. By default should work on current host.

                period – Optional argument. Is the period of iteration in seconds. Default is 0

 

program output should be sent to standard output and to output file and should look like

<process name> <hostname> <time of check> <memory> <runtime>

<process name> <hostname> <time of check> <memory> <runtime>

….

<process name> <hostname> <time of check> <memory> <runtime>
